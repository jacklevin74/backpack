# Test: Network Switching - Switch between X1 and Solana
# This test verifies network switching works correctly by:
# 1. Tapping Solana round button on top
# 2. Verifying XNT changed to SOL
# 3. Tapping X1 round button again
# 4. Verifying SOL changed back to XNT

- launchApp

# Wait for app to fully load and verify we start on X1
- assertVisible: "X1 Native Token"
- takeScreenshot: "01-initial-x1-network"

# Step 1: Tap the Solana round network button (right button)
- tapOn:
    id: "solana-network-button"
- waitForAnimationToEnd
- waitForAnimationToEnd

- takeScreenshot: "02-switched-to-solana"

# Step 2: Verify XNT changed to SOL
- assertVisible: "Solana"

# Verify the native token icon changed to Solana
- assertVisible:
    id: "native-token-icon-solana"

# Verify X1 Native Token is no longer visible
- assertNotVisible: "X1 Native Token"

# Step 3: Tap the X1 round network button to switch back (left button)
- tapOn:
    id: "x1-network-button"
- waitForAnimationToEnd
- waitForAnimationToEnd

- takeScreenshot: "03-switched-back-to-x1"

# Step 4: Verify SOL changed back to XNT
- assertVisible: "X1 Native Token"

# Verify the native token icon changed back to X1
- assertVisible:
    id: "native-token-icon-x1"

# Verify Solana text is no longer the main token
- assertNotVisible: "Solana"

# Test complete - network switching works!
